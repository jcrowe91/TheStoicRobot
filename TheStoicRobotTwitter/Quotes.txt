You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. Marcus Aurelius
Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them. Marcus Aurelius
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts. Marcus Aurelius
Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. Marcus Aurelius
Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one. Marcus Aurelius
If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment. Marcus Aurelius
When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love ... Marcus Aurelius
The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury. Marcus Aurelius
Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together,but do so with all your heart. Marcus Aurelius
The soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts. Marcus Aurelius
It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live. Marcus Aurelius
Our life is what our thoughts make it. Marcus Aurelius
Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present. Marcus Aurelius
If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed. Marcus Aurelius
If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it. Marcus Aurelius
Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking. Marcus Aurelius
I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others. Marcus Aurelius
Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? Marcus Aurelius

Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears. Marcus Aurelius
When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural. Marcus Aurelius
When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you. Marcus Aurelius
The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are. Marcus Aurelius
How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it. Marcus Aurelius
Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look. Marcus Aurelius
Here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not "This is misfortune," but "To bear this worthily is good fortune. Marcus Aurelius
Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness all of them due to the offenders ignorance of what is good or evil. Marcus Aurelius
How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy. Marcus Aurelius
You are a little soul carrying about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say. Marcus Aurelius
